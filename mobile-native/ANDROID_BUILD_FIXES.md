# Android APK Build Fixes - BeautyCita Mobile App

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Status**: Build configuration fixed - APK should now compile successfully on GitHub Actions
**Build Workflow**: `.github/workflows/build-android-mobile.yml`

---

## Problems Identified

### 1. Missing Google Services Plugin
**Issue**: Google Sign-In and Firebase-dependent libraries (OneSignal) require the Google Services Gradle plugin, but it was not configured.

**Symptoms**:
- Build would fail with missing dependencies
- Google Sign-In imports would cause compilation errors
- OneSignal push notifications couldn't initialize properly

### 2. Missing google-services.json File
**Issue**: The `google-services.json` configuration file required by the Google Services plugin was not present.

**Symptoms**:
- Gradle build would fail with "File google-services.json is missing"
- Build couldn't proceed even if Google services weren't actively used

### 3. Missing Google Play Services Dependencies
**Issue**: Native modules like Maps, Google Sign-In require Google Play Services libraries explicitly declared.

**Symptoms**:
- Runtime crashes when trying to use Google Maps
- Google Sign-In authentication failures
- Location services not working

### 4. Missing Google Maps API Key
**Issue**: Android apps using Google Maps require the API key in AndroidManifest.xml.

**Symptoms**:
- Maps would show blank screen
- "Authorization failure" errors in logs

---

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Google Services Plugin to Root build.gradle

**File**: `/var/www/beautycita.com/mobile-native/android/build.gradle`

**Changes**:
```gradle
buildscript {
    ext {
        // ... existing config ...
        googlePlayServicesVersion = "21.2.0"  // Added
    }
    dependencies {
        // ... existing dependencies ...
        classpath("com.google.gms:google-services:4.4.1")  // Added
    }
}
```

### 2. Applied Google Services Plugin in App build.gradle

**File**: `/var/www/beautycita.com/mobile-native/android/app/build.gradle`

**Changes**:
```gradle
apply plugin: "com.android.application"
apply plugin: "org.jetbrains.kotlin.android"
apply plugin: "com.facebook.react"
apply plugin: "com.google.gms.google-services"  // Added
```

### 3. Added Google Play Services Dependencies

**File**: `/var/www/beautycita.com/mobile-native/android/app/build.gradle`

**Changes**:
```gradle
dependencies {
    // ... existing dependencies ...

    // Google Play Services (Added)
    implementation("com.google.android.gms:play-services-base:${rootProject.ext.googlePlayServicesVersion}")
    implementation("com.google.android.gms:play-services-auth:${rootProject.ext.googlePlayServicesVersion}")
    implementation("com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:18.2.0")
    implementation("com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:21.2.0")
}
```

### 4. Created Placeholder google-services.json

**File**: `/var/www/beautycita.com/mobile-native/android/app/google-services.json`

**Status**: ⚠️ **PLACEHOLDER VALUES ONLY**

This file contains dummy configuration that allows the build to succeed, but **will not work at runtime** for Google Sign-In or Firebase services. See `GOOGLE_SERVICES_README.md` for instructions on adding real configuration.

### 5. Added Google Maps API Key to AndroidManifest.xml

**File**: `/var/www/beautycita.com/mobile-native/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

**Changes**:
```xml
<application ...>
    <!-- Google Maps API Key (Added) -->
    <meta-data
      android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
      android:value="AIzaSyCsy8MrU8leZ1HonRBL40s804jW91Xb5Nc"/>

    <!-- ... rest of application config ... -->
</application>
```

**Note**: This API key is from CLAUDE.md and is domain-restricted to beautycita.com. It should work for development/testing purposes.

## Build Status

### ✅ What Should Work Now

1. **Android APK Compilation**: The build should complete successfully on GitHub Actions
2. **Native Module Linking**: All native modules should link properly during build
3. **App Installation**: APK should install and launch on Android devices
4. **Basic Functionality**:
   - Navigation
   - UI rendering
   - API calls to backend
   - Local storage (AsyncStorage)
   - Biometric authentication
   - Image picker
   - Geolocation

### ⚠️ What Needs Additional Configuration

These features are **coded in the app** but require additional setup to work:

1. **Google Sign-In**: Requires real google-services.json with OAuth 2.0 credentials
2. **OneSignal Push Notifications**: Requires OneSignal App ID + real google-services.json (for FCM)
3. **Google Maps**: Should work with current API key, but verify it's not rate-limited
4. **Stripe Payments**: Requires Stripe publishable key configuration

See the code files that need updates:
- `src/services/authService.ts` - Line 23: Update `webClientId`
- `src/services/notificationService.ts` - Line 21: Update `ONESIGNAL_APP_ID`

---

## Verification Steps

### Test the Build Locally (If Android SDK Available)

```bash
cd /var/www/beautycita.com/mobile-native/android
./gradlew assembleRelease --no-daemon
```

Expected: Build succeeds, APK created at:
`app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

### Test on GitHub Actions

1. Push changes to the repository
2. Workflow should trigger automatically (watches `mobile-native/**` path)
3. Or manually trigger: Go to Actions → "Build Android APK" → "Run workflow"

Expected:
- Build completes successfully
- APK artifact uploaded
- APK uploaded to R2 bucket
- Build summary shows APK size and location

## Troubleshooting

### Build Still Fails

**Check**:
1. Node modules installed: `cd mobile-native && npm ci`
2. Gradle cache cleared: `cd android && ./gradlew clean`
3. Android SDK version matches (SDK 34, Build Tools 34.0.0)

### Maps Not Working After Install

**Possible Causes**:
1. API key domain restriction (key only works on beautycita.com)
2. Maps SDK not enabled in Google Cloud Console
3. Network connectivity issues

**Fix**: Create unrestricted API key for development, or add device identifier to restrictions

### Google Sign-In Crashes

**Expected**: The app will crash or fail gracefully because google-services.json has placeholder values. This is normal until real configuration is added.

### OneSignal Not Receiving Notifications

**Expected**: Push notifications won't work until:
1. Real google-services.json added (for FCM)
2. OneSignal App ID configured in code
3. Device registered with OneSignal
