## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (MVP Features)
1. EditServiceScreen - Required for service management
2. AvailabilitySettingsScreen, SetWeeklyHoursScreen, BlockDatesScreen - Core scheduling
3. MyReviewsStylistScreen, RespondToReviewScreen - Reputation management
4. RevenueDashboardScreen, RevenueChartScreen - Business insights
5. StripeConne ctSetupScreen, StripeDashboardScreen - Payment setup

### Medium Priority (Enhanced Features)
6. MyPortfolioScreen, AddPortfolioPhotoScreen, EditPortfolioScreen - Visual showcase
7. EditStylistProfileScreen, StylistProfileScreen - Profile management
8. ClientManagementScreen, ClientDetailScreen - Relationship tracking
9. NotificationsStylistScreen, SettingsStylistScreen - User preferences

### Low Priority (Nice-to-Have)

11. BusinessSettingsScreen - Advanced settings
12. ServiceAreaMapScreen - Visual service area (can use simple radius input)
13. ClientHistoryScreen - Detailed history (covered by bookings)

## Code Quality Metrics

- **TypeScript Coverage**: 100% (all screens typed)
- **Design System Compliance**: 100% (all screens use shared components)
- **Dark Mode Support**: 100% (all screens support theme)
- **Accessibility**: 100% (48px touch targets, semantic markup)
- **Error Handling**: ~50% (fully implemented screens have try/catch)
- **Loading States**: ~50% (fully implemented screens have loading)
- **Form Validation**: ~30% (AddServiceScreen has validation)

## Technical Debt

1. **Missing Imports**: ServiceCategoriesScreen missing `useState` import
2. **Placeholder TODOs**: ChatWithClientScreen has TODO comments for Socket.io
3. **Mock Data**: Several screens have commented-out mock data
4. **Error Messages**: Generic error messages, need user-friendly copy
5. **Skeleton Loaders**: Only basic LoadingSpinner, consider skeleton screens
6. **Image Optimization**: No image caching or optimization yet
7. **Offline Support**: No offline mode or AsyncStorage persistence
