📄 WHY THE MAPPING FILE IS NEEDED:
----------------------------------
When your app crashes or throws errors in production:
- Stack traces are obfuscated/minified
- Google Play needs the mapping file to translate them back
- This helps you debug issues reported by users
- Without it, crash reports will be unreadable

The mapping file contains:
- Original class names → Obfuscated names
- Original method names → Obfuscated names  
- Line number mappings
