        "paragraph1": "BeautyCita was born in 2023 in Puerto Vallarta - not Silicon Valley, not a tech hub, but a beautiful coastal city where real people face real problems booking beauty services. We started with a laptop, hustle, and a simple belief: beauty professionals deserve better tools, and clients deserve easier booking.",
        "paragraph2": "We didn't raise venture capital or launch with millions in funding. We couldn't afford fancy offices or big marketing budgets. Instead, we walked door-to-door talking to salon owners, sat with stylists to understand their pain points, and listened to clients who were frustrated with flaky booking systems. Every line of code, every design, every video - we created it ourselves. We even wrote our own theme song because we believe in authentic creativity over corporate branding.",
        "paragraph3": "Today, we're approaching 10,000 bookings processed, and we're aiming for 50,000 clients. Not because of aggressive ads or paid influencers, but because stylists tell other stylists, and happy clients tell their friends. That's grassroots growth - slow, authentic, sustainable.",
        "paragraph4": "Our business model is built on partnership: We take a small commission (typically 3%) from each booking. That's it. No hidden fees, no subscription traps. This lets us provide the platform, handle payments securely, offer customer support, and market the service - all while letting stylists keep 97% of what they earn. When they succeed, we succeed. It's honest, transparent, and built to last.",
        "paragraph5": "We're looking for people who believe in this approach - folks who understand that building something meaningful takes time, that community trust beats viral growth, and that everyone should earn together. If you're tired of corporate buzzwords and want to build something real with a scrappy, creative team, you're in the right place."
